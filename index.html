          Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, creatures
          that look like normal people but can only survive by eating human
          flesh, live among the human population in secrecy, hiding their true
          nature in order to evade pursuit from the authorities. Ghouls have
          powers including enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a
          regular ghoul produces 4–7 times more kinetic energy in their muscles
          than a normal human; they also have several times the RC cells, a cell
          that flows like blood and can become solid instantly. A ghoul's skin
          is resistant to ordinary piercing weapons, and it has at least one
          special predatory organ called a kagune (Japanese: 赫子), which it can
          manifest and use as a weapon during combat. Another distinctive trait
          of ghouls is that when they are excited or hungry, the color of their
          sclera in both eyes turns black and their irises red
